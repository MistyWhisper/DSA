/* Requirement:
	(1) UML of MaxHeap(08 Heaps and Heapsort.pptx, page 40):
		|-----------------------------------------------|
		|                    MaxHeap                    |
		|-----------------------------------------------|
		|   - A: int[]                                  |
		|   - size: int                                 |
		|-----------------------------------------------|
		|   + MaxHeap(int A[])                          |
		|   + insert(int x): boolean                    |
		|   + deleteMax(): int                          |
		|   + heapSort(int A[]): static void            |
		|   + main(): static void                       |
		|-----------------------------------------------|
	* Note: Underline is always used to show methods or variables which are static in UML. But the 
	underline cannot be typed out in code editor, so we use another way to tell you about that.
	
	(2) You are NOT allowed to modify the code originally given in MaxHeap.java
	(3) You are NOT allowed to modify the filename of MaxHeap.java
	(4) You are NOT allowed to use Chinese characters in codes or comments
	(5) The class name, variable names and method names should STRICTLY follow the UML above
	(6)	You should add some comments and indentations to make the codes user friendly
